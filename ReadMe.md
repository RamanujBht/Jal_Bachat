# Digital Knowledge Sharing Platform for Water-Efficient Techniques

## Project Overview

This project is a **Digital Knowledge Sharing Platform** designed to address water scarcity by providing a centralized repository for water-efficient techniques and methods. The platform aims to connect communities, researchers, and policymakers by sharing knowledge through peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and success stories. It includes an admin panel for content management and allows users to contribute their knowledge.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the platform with sections on case studies, community forums, and water-saving techniques.
- **Admin Panel:** Secure access for administrators to manage and upload articles or approve user submissions.
- **Water Savings Calculator:** An interactive tool to help users estimate potential water savings.
- **Responsive Design:** Accessible across devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **User Contribution:** Allows users to submit water-efficient techniques and participate in discussions.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** 
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** 
  - PHP (for admin panel, user submissions)
- **Database:** 
  - MySQL (for storing articles, users, and other platform data)
